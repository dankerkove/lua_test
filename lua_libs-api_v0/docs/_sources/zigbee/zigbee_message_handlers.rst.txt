Zigbee Driver RX message handlers
=================================
These are handlers that can be used to handle any incoming :lua:class:`ZigbeeMessageRx <messages.ZigbeeMessageRx>`.  In
general, there are 4 common types of handlers that can be simply defined and automatically handled by the driver
infrastructure.  These are:
#. ZCL attribute value handlers
#. ZCL global command handlers
#. ZCL cluster specific command handlers
#. ZDO handlers.
A further description of each is provided below.

In order for one of these message handlers to be registered, the driver will provide a table with the registrations
included in it.  There are also included a number of default handlers that can be registered based on a list of
capabilities.  This can be done using:

.. code-block:: lua

    local defaults = require "st.zigbee.defaults"
    defaults.register_for_default_handlers(driver_template, { capabilities.switch, capabilities.switchLevel })


These defaults can be overridden explicitly, never registered, or left as-is
and expanded by registering additional handlers.  The following is an example of additional handlers added in a driver:

.. code-block:: lua

    local generate_event_from_zone_status = function(driver, device, zone_status)
      capabilities.emit_event(device, driver.capability_socket, (zone_status:is_alarm1_set() or zone_status:is_alarm2_set()) and capabilities.WaterSensor.water.wet() or capabilities.WaterSensor.water.dry())
    end

    local ias_zone_status_attr_handler = function(driver, device, attr_val)
      generate_event_from_zone_status(driver, device, ZoneStatus(attr_val.value))
    end

    local ias_zone_status_change_handler = function(driver, device, zigbee_message)
      generate_event_from_zone_status(driver, device, zigbee_message.body.zone_status)
    end

    handlers = {
      global = {},
      cluster = {
        [IasZoneCluster.ID] = {
          [IasZoneCluster.commands.server.ZoneStatusChangeNotification.ID] = ias_zone_status_change_handler
        }
      },
      attr = {
        [IasZoneCluster.ID] = {
          [IasZoneCluster.attributes.ZoneStatus.ID] = ias_zone_status_attr_handler
        }
      },
      zdo = {}
    }

    -- This handlers table could then be used with the zigbee driver utils to register/build a driver

Here we are adding one cluster specific handler and one attribute handler.  Both are for handling zone
status values.


ZCL attribute value handler
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following is a prototype definition of an attribute handler:

.. lua:function:: zcl_attribute_value_handler(driver, device, attr_val, zb_rx)

    Handle an attribute value sent from the device (either via a read attribute response or a report attribute global
    message).

    :param driver: the driver context
    :type driver: Driver
    :param device: the device reporting the attribute
    :type device: Device
    :param attr_val: the attribute value
    :type attr_val: DataType
    :param zb_rx: the full Zigbee message this value is being extracted from
    :type zb_rx: messages.ZigbeeMessageRx

If this handler type is registered, it will be nested as follows:
"attr"->cluster_id->attribute_id->handler, that is, it is named as an "attr" handler, then it is associated with a
specific cluster and attribute.  When either a
:lua:class:`read attribute response <read_attr_response.ReadAttributeResponse>` or
:lua:class:`report attribute <report_attr.ReportAttribute>` message is received matching the cluster and attribute, that
value will be passed into the handler function on receipt.  Note that a read attribute response value will only call the
handler if the status was success.

Below is an example. By default this is registered for cluster `0x0006`
(On Off cluster) attribute `0x0000` (On Off attribute) if the "Switch" capability is listed as supported.

.. code-block:: lua

    local OnOffCluster = (require "st.zigbee.zcl.clusters").OnOffCluster
    local capabilities = require "st.capabilities"

    --- Default handler for on off attribute on the on off cluster
    ---
    --- This converts the boolean value from true -> Switch.switch.on and false to Switch.switch.off.
    ---
    --- @param driver Driver The current driver running containing necessary context for execution
    --- @param device ZigbeeDevice The device this message was received from containing identifying information
    --- @param value Boolean the value of the On Off cluster On Off attribute
    local on_off_attr_handler = function (driver, device, value)
      local attr = capabilities.switch.switch
      device:emit_event(value.value and attr.on() or attr.off())
    end

    local zigbee_handlers = {
        attr = {
          [OnOffCluster.ID] = {
            [OnOffCluster.attributes.OnOff.ID] = on_off_attr_handler
          }
        }
      }


ZCL global command handler
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Below is a prototype function defining a global command handler:

.. lua:function:: zcl_global_command_handler(driver, device, zb_rx)

    Handle a ZCL message using a global command.

    :param driver: the driver context
    :type driver: Driver
    :param device: the device reporting the attribute
    :type device: Device
    :param zb_rx: the Zigbee message received
    :type zb_rx: messages.ZigbeeMessageRx


If this handler type is registered it will be nested as follows:
"global"->cluster_id->command_id->handler, that is, it is named as a "global" handler, then it is associated with a
specific cluster and command.  When either a message is received matching the cluster and attribute, and the frame
control cluster specific flag is false, the entire parsed :lua:class:`ZigbeeMessageRx <messages.ZigbeeMessageRx>` will
be passed into the handler.

Below is an example of a method that will handle any read or report
attribute message on the SmartThings-specific acceleration cluster `0xFC04`.  This is done as a global command handler
instead of an attribute handler because we expect to receive and want to act on multiple attribute reports in a single
message, not a single attribute value.

.. code-block:: lua

    local zcl_commands = require "st.zigbee.zcl.global_commands"
    local capabilities = require "st.capabilities"

    --- Handler for SmartThings multi sensor threeAxis acceleration events
    ---
    --- This is a report attribute message handler and if there are values present for each of the x y and z axis
    --- accelerations a threeAxis event will be generated
    ---
    --- @param driver Driver The current driver running containing necessary context for execution
    --- @param device ZigbeeDevice The device this message was received from containing identifying information
    --- @param zbrx ZigbeeMessageRx the message that matched the cluster and command
    local function three_axis_report_handler(driver, device, zbrx)
      local x, y, z
      for i,v in ipairs(zbrx.body.zcl_body.attr_records) do
        if (v.attr_id.value == 0x0012) then
          x = v.data.value
        elseif (v.attr_id.value == 0x0013) then
          y = v.data.value
        elseif (v.attr_id.value == 0x0014) then
          z = v.data.value
        end
      end
      if x ~= nil and y ~= nil and z ~= nil then
        device:emit_event(capabilities.threeAxis.threeAxis({value ={x, y, z}}))
      end
    end

    local zigbee_handlers = {
        global = {
          [0xFC02] = {
            [zcl_commands.ReportAttribute.ID] = three_axis_report_handler
          }
        }
      }


ZCL cluster command handler
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Below is a prototype defining the ZCL cluster command handler:

.. lua:function:: zcl_cluster_command_handler(driver, device, zb_rx)

    Handle a ZCL message using a cluster specific command.

    :param driver: the driver context
    :type driver: Driver
    :param device: the device reporting the attribute
    :type device: Device
    :param zb_rx: the Zigbee message received
    :type zb_rx: messages.ZigbeeMessageRx


If this handler type is registered it will be nested as follows:
"cluster"->cluster_id->command_id->handler, that is, it is named as an "cluster" handler, then it is associated with a
specific cluster and command.  When either a message is received matching the cluster and attribute, and the frame
control cluster specific flag is true, the entire parsed :lua:class:`ZigbeeMessageRx <messages.ZigbeeMessageRx>` will
be passed into the handler.

There are no default handlers implemented that are cluster handlers.  However a common example for a driver would be
handling the Zone Status Change Notification command on the IAS Zone cluster.  That is a cluster specific command that
will need handling on devices that use it.  However, a default handler is not included because that message does not
map to a single event type but is instead device-specific.  Below is an example of one such handler for a moisture
sensor:

.. code-block:: lua

    local IasZoneCluster = (require "st.zigbee.zcl.clusters").IasZoneCluster
    local capabilities = require "st.capabilities"

    --- Handler for the cluster specific command ZoneStatusChangeNotification on the IasZoneCluster
    ---
    --- @param driver Driver The current driver running containing necessary context for execution
    --- @param device ZigbeeDevice The device this message was received from containing identifying information
    --- @param zb_rx ZigbeeMessageRx the Zigbee message received
    local ias_zone_status_change_handler = function(driver, device, zb_rx)
      local zone_status = zb_rx.body.zcl_body.zone_status
      device:emit_event(
          (zone_status:is_alarm1_set() or zone_status:is_alarm2_set()) and
              capabilities.waterSensor.water.wet() or
              capabilities.waterSensor.water.dry()
      )
    end

    local zigbee_handlers = {
            cluster = {
              [IasZoneCluster.ID] = {
                [IasZoneCluster.commands.server.ZoneStatusChangeNotification.ID] = ias_zone_status_change_handler
              }
            }
        }


ZDO command handler
+++++++++++++++++++


Below is a prototype function defining a zdo handler:

.. lua:function:: zdo_handler(driver, device, zb_rx)

    Handle a ZCL message using a global command.

    :param driver: the driver context
    :type driver: Driver
    :param device: the device reporting the attribute
    :type device: Device
    :param zb_rx: the Zigbee message received
    :type zb_rx: messages.ZigbeeMessageRx

If this handler type is registered it will be nested as follows:
"zdo"->cluster_id->handler, that is, it is named as an "zdo" handler, then it is associated with a
specific cluster.  When  a message is received matching the cluster and profile (zdo) the entire parsed
:lua:class:`ZigbeeMessageRx <messages.ZigbeeMessageRx>` will be passed into the handler.  There are not currently any
examples using these, and it is unlikely you will need one for your drivers.
