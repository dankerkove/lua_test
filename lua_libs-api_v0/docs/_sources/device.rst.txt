Devices
=======

In order for a driver to do its job it will need to know information about the devices that it is responsible for.
Information about these devices is done through the "device_api" object that is provided in the environment.  There
are a few main ways to interact with this, but the most common will be the ``get_device_list()`` and
``get_device_info(<device_uuid>)`` functions.  ``get_device_list()`` will return a list of UUIDs for all the devices that
are managed by the current driver. ``get_device_info(<device_uuid>)`` can be used directly, but it is recommended to use
the helper function ``driver:get_device_info()``.  The primary reason for that is because this method will build a
``Device`` object in lua that provides many utility functions and abstractions that will simplify many normal use cases
instead of providing a raw json string, .  It will also provide relevant caching and updating on changes
that originate outside the driver.  In addition a driver can provide a ``post_device_info_handler`` function that can do
additional processing after the provided processing.

Below is an example of what is returned using the ``device_api.get_device_info(<device_uuid>)`` function

Device Class
------------

The device class is the wrapper on top of the raw data provided by the ``device_api``.
The device class table will store information in a variety of different locations, and
these locations will be protected with metatables.  Following are the main pieces to the
device object.

st_store:
    This is used to store the above shown representation of the SmartThings device
    model.  It is read only, and will be updated automatically if there are changes in the
    model from an external source (e.g. a change in the cloud).  The top level values of this
    table are also "mirrored" onto the device object itself.  That is ``device.st_store.id``
    will give you the device's UUID to refer to the device in the SmartThings platform, but you
    can also access this value simply through ``device.id``.  This is done for simplicity of
    access.

transient_store:
    The transient_store is used for storing driver/device specific information.
    This information however, will only exist as long as the driver is running, and will need
    to be re-populated where necessary on restart of the hub.  A good example of this would be
    storing the timestamp of the last time you read a given attribute.  It's something that is
    only useful within the context of the specific driver, but is easily re-constructed after
    a restart.  It is suggested that most of your data can/should be stored this way.  It is
    also recommended that most user/driver stored data be accessed/set using the
    ``device:set_field`` and ``device:get_field`` methods documented below.

persistent_store:
    Similar to the transient_store, this is for use for driver specific
    information, however, unlike the transient_store, information written here will be stored
    and persisted through restarts.  This carries with it a cost in wear, as well as time delays
    associated with the writing and reading.  This should also be accessed through the
    ``device:set_field`` and ``device:get_field`` methods.  A good example of a target for the
    persistent store would be something like the number of lock codes a lock can support.  This
    is something that only needs to be read once when the device is first joined, and won't
    change for the lifetime of the device.  This could be read every time the driver restarts, but
    it is reasonable to read once and store for the lifetime of the device.  In order to protect the
    longevity of your hub device, we limit how frequently values are actually written to flash. This
    does, however, come with a potential loss of information.  When the persistent store for your
    driver is "written" it is cached in memory and will actually be written to flash on a schedule
    and on graceful shutdown.  This means there is potential information loss in the case of a power
    loss.

state_cache:
    The state cache is a transient data cache that will keep track for each component,
    capability, attribute, what the most recent generated state was.  So
    ``device.state_cache.main.switch`` would contain ``{ value = "on" }``.

The ``set_field`` and ``get_field`` functions can be used to write and read from the persistent
and transient stores.  It is enforced that top level keys cannot be repeated between the two
stores, as such ``get_field`` will always return the single value with the matching key.
Consequently ``set_field`` will delete the value in the other store if it is written to the
other.

There are also a variety of other utility methods documented below.
