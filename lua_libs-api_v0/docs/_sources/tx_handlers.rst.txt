Zigbee Driver Capability Command Handlers
=========================================

This module contains a set of default capability command handlers.  See
:lua:meth:`<command_handlers.zigbee_capability_command_handler> zigbee_capability_command_handler` for the template of
what these handlers look like.  These will each be matched with a specific capability command pair, and will then be
called when that command is sent from an automation, mobile app, or other actuation.

Default handlers available

Following are a number of default implementations of handlers.  Many of these will be automatically associated with a
capability unless overridden.
